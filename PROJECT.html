            CARTOONING AN IMAGE USING OPEN CV
            <p> <i>The basic concept in this algorithm involves the technique of converting the RGB colour image to an 
                accurate, cartooned image without multiple filtrations or blurred image without proper facilitation of edge detection. This user interface allows to apply the animation effects. This naturally provides an artistic effect and comics as well with wide range of pictures.</i></p>

            FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION USING BIOMETRIC
            <p>
                <i>This biometrics project focuses on Fingerprint Recognition and how such a 
            system would be implemented, This system would confirm the level of accuracy of 
            fingerprint matching the identity of each individual attending to gain access to a 
        given amount of precision. Here each fingerprint is sub-classified into several 
minutiae and hereby we used SIFT detector which allows identification of 
localized features (keypoints) in sample image also known as Object Recognition 
in Images</i></p>

            BLOCKCHAIN BASED ELECTRONIC HELATH RECORD MANAGEMENT
            <p><i>
                Electronically recorded health data in a digital format is called an electronic health record, or EHR. EHRs are commonly shared among healthcare stakeholders and are susceptible to issues such as power outages, data abuse, lack of security, privacy, and audit trails. The breakthrough innovation of the 20th century, blockchain, on the other hand, provides a distributed and decentralized environment for communication among nodes in a list of networks without the need for a central authority. In addition to offering a more secure, decentralized, and safe environment for sharing EHR data, it can alleviate the shortcomings of EHR administration. An electronic health record (EHR) is a technology that allows you to keep track of your health information. It keeps computerized records of several healthcare organizations. Records are exchanged via enterprise-wide data systems as well as other networking technologies and exchanges.
